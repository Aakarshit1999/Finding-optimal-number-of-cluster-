# Finding-optimal-number-of-cluster-
To find the optimal number clusters for a given Iris dataset and presenting the output.
To do this I used R as my language and RStudio as the console to perform every function.
Firstly we imported the csv format dataset into the consoleand then removed the species column to make the calculations easier for me.
Then I imported the libraries ggplot2,factoextra and nbclust to perform kmeans , clustering and plotting the graph for the values evaluated.
